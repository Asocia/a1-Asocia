        <h2>Get to Know Your Rubik's Cube</h2>
        <h3>A. Definitions of Rubik's Cube Pieces</h3>
        <p>
            Basically there are 3 type of pieces.

            <dt>Corner Pieces</dt>
            <dd>Pieces that contains 3 colors. There are 8 corner pieces where in the corners of the cube.</dd>

            <dt>Center Pieces</dt>
            <dd>Pieces that contains 1 color. There are 6 center pieces where in the center of each side. Center pieces never move so they represent the color of their side.


        </dl>
        <h3>B. Basic Notation for Describing Moves </h3>
        <img alt="Visualizing the notations" class="sd" src="ntts.png" />
        <p>
            We use 6 different letters to express the solving algorithms. All letters are intuitive so you don't need to worry about it. Here they are:

        </p>

        <ul class="Notations">
            <li>R = Right --> Rotate right side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>L = Left --> Rotate left side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>U = Up --> Rotate top side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>D = Down --> Rotate bottom side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>F = Front --> Rotate front side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>B = Back --> Rotate back side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>A letter followed by an apostrophe (') means counter-clockwise move when looking at that face directly. <br>A letter with the number 2 after means that turn that face in 180 degrees.</p>

        <h1>Stage 2:</h1>
        <h2>Solve the White Cross</h2>
        <h3>Holding Your Cube</h3>
        <p>
            Holding your cube with the white center piece on the top (U) face, you must create a white cross to the right. Much of this level is achieved with practice and by trial and error... But we have some tips to do.
        </p>
        <h4 class="tip">Tips:</h4>
        <p>Note that there are more efficient ways to doing this but if you are new you can follow this instructions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be sure to solve the sections of the white cross in the following order -blue, orange, green, red.</li>
            <li>Notice the edge piece colors above match the top white center piece and the side red and blue center pieces. This is how we know the edge pieces are in the correct positions.
            </li>
            <li>Keeping the white center piece on top, move the blue/white edge piece to the bottom (D) face, then rotate it on the bottom untill it is directly under the blue center piece. Now hold your cube so the blue center piece and blue/white edge piece are on the right (R) face. Then rotate the right face in 180 degrees.</li>
            <li>If your cube looks like this, hold your cube so the orange piece is on the right face and start solving the side with orange center piece the same way as started above.
            </li>
            <li>If your cube looks like this, do this algorithm while holding the corresponding center piece of the cube is on the right side

            </li>


        </ul>
        <p class="alg">R' U F' U'</p>
        <div class="next">
            <h4><img height="100" alt="Cross on the White Face" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f2df67e4b079e94c291e4f/t/55150cb5e4b0413cd5dfbe67/1427442870792/cross+done+u+cross.png">Congratulations!</h4>
            <p>If your cube looks like this, you can move to next stage.

        <h1>Stage 3:</h1>
        <h2>Solve The White Corners</h2>
        <h3>Holding Your Cube</h3>
        <p>With the white cross on top face, you must solve the white corner pieces.</p>
        <h4 class="tip">Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Corner pieces will have one white side plus 2 other colors.</li>
            <li>If the corner piece is already on the bottom face, then rotate the bottom face untill the corner is directly below its intended location. Once in that position, your cube may look like any of the 3 pictures on the right. </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Then do the sequence below untill it is in the correct position.</p>
        <p class="alg">R' D' R D</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Repeat this process for all white corners.</li>
            <li>If the corner piece is on the top face, move it to the bottom face by doing:</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Stage 4:</h1>
        <h2>Solve The Middle Layer</h2>
        <h3>Holding Your Cube</h3>
        <p>With the completed white layer on the bottom, now you have to solve the middle layer. Which means positioning the <b>edge pieces</b> in the correct place.</p>
        <h4 class="tip">Tips:</h4>

        <img id="sp" height=100 alt="The piece needs to go left side." src="https://how-to-solve-a-rubix-cube.com/img/solution-3-f2l-left-algorithm.png">
        <ul>
            <li>If your edge piece needs to go to the right side as shown the first picture above, do this algorithm:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alg">U R U' R' U' F' U F</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your edge piece needs to go to the left side as shown the second picture above, do this algorithm:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alg">U' L' U L U F U' F'</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue doing these steps for all edge pieces.</li>
            <li>If one of your edge pieces is already in the middle row, but in the wrong position, then do either one of the sequential moves, and it will move to the top layer. Then you can move the piece its correct position. </li>

        <h3>Holding Your Cube</h3>
        <p>With the yellow side of the cube on top, now twist the top face until at least 2 corners are in the right location. 2 corners <b>must</b> be in the right location as A,B or A,D or B,C as shown below. If all 4 corners are in right place the proceed to 2<sup>nd</sup> step. </p>
        <h4>1<sup>st</sup> Step: Position yellow corners correctly</h4>
        <p>While holding your cube as shown the right side, look at the top face. Place the 2 correct corners in the back A,B or diagonally A,D or B,C across from each other. <img height=90 alt="Corners are respectivly A-B-C-D" src="https://eu.rubiks.com/uploads/blog_entries/3_s6.png"></p>

        <p>If you need to <b>switch diagonal corners</b> like B and C or D and A,then do the sequence once. Then, orient the cube so the 2 correct corners are in the back and do the sequence again.</p>
