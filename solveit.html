        <h2>Get to Know Your Rubik's Cube</h2>
        <h3>A. Definitions of Rubik's Cube Pieces</h3>
        <p>
          Basically there are 3 type of pieces.
          <dl>
            <dt>Edge Pieces</dt>
            <dd >Pieces that contains 2 colors. There are 12 edge pieces where in the middle of rows.</dd>
            <img height="200" width="200" src="http://www.easyways.net/wp-content/uploads/rubikscubeedgepieces.png"/>
             <dt>Corner Pieces</dt>
            <dd >Pieces that contains 3 colors. There are 8 corner pieces where in the corners of the cube.</dd>
            <img height="200" width="200" src="http://www.easyways.net/wp-content/uploads/Rubiks_cube.svg_.png"/>
             <dt>Center Pieces</dt>
            <dd >Pieces that contains 1 color. There are 6 center pieces where in the center of each side. Center pieces never move
            so they represent the color of their side.
            </dd>
           <img height="200" width="200" src="http://www.easyways.net/wp-content/uploads/centerpieces.png"/>
          </dl>
        </p>
         <h3>B. Basic Notation for Describing Moves </h3>
        <p>
          We use 6 different letters to express the solving algorithms. All letters are intuitive so you don't need to worry about it.
          Here they are:
          <ul class="Notations" >
            <li>R = Right  --> Rotate right side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>L = Left   --> Rotate left side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>U = Up     --> Rotate top side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>D = Down   --> Rotate bottom side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>F = Front  --> Rotate front side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>B = Back   --> Rotate back side of the cube clockwise in 90 degrees.</li>
           <img alt="Visualizing the notations" class="sd"
                src="https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/JR3N/HDYZ6UG0/F5PJR3NHDYZ6UG0.MEDIUM.jpg"/>
           </ul>
          A letter followed by an apostrophe (') means counter-clockwise move when looking at that face directly.
          A letter with the number 2 after means that turn that face in 180 degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example algorithm for the things you learnt:
          R U R' U' F U2
          
          [URL="https://alg.cubing.net/?alg=__R_U_R-_U-_F_U2&view=playback"]  R U R' U' F U2[/URL]
          
        </p>
        <h1>Stage 2:</h1>
        <h2>Sove the White Cross</h2>
        <h3>Holding Your Cube</h3>
        <p>
          Holding your cube with the white center piece on the top (U) face, you must create a white cross
          to the right. Much of this level is achieved with practice and by trial and error...
          But we have some tips to do.
        </p>
        <h4>Tips:</h4>
        <p>Note that there are more efficient ways to doing this but if you are new you can follow this
        instructions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be sure to solve the sections of the white cross in the following order -blue, orange,
          green, red.</li>
          <li>Notice the edge piece colors above match the top white center piece and the
          side red and blue center pieces. This is how we know the edge pieces are in the correct
          positions.</li>
          <li>Keeping the white center piece on top, move the blue/white edge piece to the bottom
          (D) face, then rotate it on the bottom untill it is directly under the blue center piece.
          Now hold your cube so the blue center piece and blue/white edge piece are on the right (R) face.
          Then rotate the right face in 180 degrees.</li>
          <li>If your cube looks like this, hold your cube so the orange piece is on the right face
          and start solving the side with orange center piece the same way as started above.
          </li>
          <li>If your cube looks like this, do this algorithm while holding the corresponding center
          piece of the cube is on the right side
         
          </li>
          
          
        </ul>
         <p class="alg">R' U F' U'</p>
         <div class="next"> <h4>Congratulations!</h4>
         <p>If your cube looks like this, you can move to
         next stage.
